# üìñ Redux Dictionary App

A simple and clean dictionary web application built to demonstrate the core principles of modern Redux with Redux Toolkit. Users can search for a word and view its definitions, parts of speech, and phonetic spelling, fetched from a public API.  

This project serves as a practical, hands-on example for anyone learning state management in React.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Word Search:** Input a word to look up its definition.  
- **Dynamic Results:** Fetches and displays definitions, phonetics, parts of speech, and examples.  
- **State Management:** Utilizes a centralized Redux store to manage application state, including loading, error, and data states.  
- **Asynchronous Logic:** Handles API calls gracefully using `createAsyncThunk`.  
- **Responsive:** Simple, mobile-first design.

- **Framework:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)  
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)  
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  
- **State Management:** [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) & [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)  
- **API Client:** [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for making HTTP requests  
- **Styling:** Plain CSS

### The Redux Fairytale üè∞
To understand *why* Redux is so useful and how its core parts (Store, Actions, Reducers, `useSelector`) work together, we created a simple story. This analogy explains Redux by comparing it to a family building a central store to share items, solving the problem of "prop drilling."
